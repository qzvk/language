An experimental functional language interpreter.

# Building

To build, you'll need Rust's [Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) tool installed. You can run the interpreter on a file by doing `cargo run -- <FILENAME>` or see help info by doing `cargo run -- --help`.

# To-do

Currently, only lexical and syntactical analysis are happening at the moment. Semantic analysis and an internal representation still need to be written to even be able to 'interpret' anything.
